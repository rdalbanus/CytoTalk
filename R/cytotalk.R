#' CytoTalk: Construct signal transduction networks
#'
#' The CytoTalk package allows for *de novo* construction of a signaling
#' network (pathways from ligand-receptor pairs) between two cell types using
#' single- cell transcriptomics data (scRNA-seq).
#'
#' @section Running CytoTalk:
#' The central wrapper function, `run_cytotalk`, is
#' the main entry point to the package. Most users should start here. Check out
#' its MAN page by executing `?run_cytotalk` in your R console.
#'
#' @section Advanced Users:
#' If you're willing to do some digging, CytoTalk is
#' composed of many steps, some of which could be interchangeable with other
#' computational methods. For example, let's say that you have a different idea
#' for computing intra- cellular similarity (i.e. not a mutual information
#' matrix). You could skip steps 1-3 and attempt to run from step 4 onward
#' (simply execute `run_cytotalk` in your console to view the source code) with
#' differently integrated data. Currently, doing so is not user-friendly, so
#' this is recommended for developers only. However, it would be interesting to
#' make the different components of the overall process more modular to compare
#' sub processes.

#' Run CytoTalk Process
#'
#' Runs all sub processes of CytoTalk. At minimum, the folder that contains
#' your scRNA-seq data, `dir_in`, and the two cell types corresponding to that
#' data, `type_a` and `type_b`, must be specified. It is also recommended you
#' set the output directory, `dir_out`. If you have data from a species other
#' that mice, please read the descriptions for the `proteins` and `ligands`
#' arguments. If you would like a more selective run (i.e. smaller, filters out
#' more lowly- expressed genes), please increase both cutoff values `cutoff_a`
#' and `cutoff_b`. Lastly, intermediate results will be reused, so if you want
#' a fresh run, either output to a new output folder or delete the files in a
#' particular output folder.
#'
#' @examples \dontrun{
#' # set location of data and output folder
#' dir_in <- "~/scRNAseq-data"
#' dir_out <- "~/CytoTalk-output"
#'
#' # examine if your filenames are correct
#' check_valid_names(dir_in)
#'
#' # select which cell types to compare
#' type_a <- "BCells"
#' type_b <- "TCells"
#'
#' # if desired, run a small test with highly-expressed genes
#' run_cytotalk(type_a, type_b, dir_in, dir_out = "my-test",
#'              cutoff_a = 0.75, cutoff_b = 0.75)
#'
#' # finally, run the full process
#' run_cytotalk(type_a, type_b, dir_in, dir_out)
#' }
#'
#' @param type_a Name of cell type A that matches scRNA-seq file; for example,
#' `"BCells"`
#'
#' @param type_b Name of cell type B that matches scRNA-seq file; for example,
#' `"TCells"` 
#'
#' @param dir_in Folder containing scRNA-seq data
#'
#' @param dir_out Folder used for output; if not specified, a "CytoTalk-output"
#' folder will be generated 
#'
#' @param proteins A character vector, contains the names of protein coding
#' genes; by default, uses the `pcg_human` data. This package also includes
#' `pcg_mouse`, but you can also use your own data 
#'
#' @param ligands A dataframe or matrix object with two columns, ligands names
#' and the names of their receptors; by default, uses the `ligands_human` data.
#' This package also includes `ligands_mouse`, but you can also use your own
#' data
#'
#' @param cutoff_a Proportional threshold for lowly expressed genes in cell
#' type A (range of \[0-1\]); for example, 0.1 means genes with some expression
#' in at least 10% of cells are retained 
#'
#' @param cutoff_b Proportional expression threshold for cell type B (range of
#' \[0-1\]) 
#'
#' @param beta_max Upper limit of the test values of the PCSF objective
#' function parameter $I^2$, which is inversely proportional to the total
#' number of genes in a given cell-type pair; suggested to be 100 (default) if
#' the total number of genes in a given cell-type pair is above 10,000; if the
#' total number of genes is below 5,000, increase to 500 
#'
#' @param omega_min Start point of omega range; omega represents the edge cost
#' of the artificial network, but has been found to be less significant than
#' beta. Recommended minimum of `0.5`.
#'
#' @param omega_max End point of range between `omega_min` and `omega_max`,
#' step size of `0.1`. Recommended maximum of `1.5`. 
#'
#' @param depth Starting at each ligand-receptor pair in the resultant network,
#' how many steps out from that pair should be taken to generate each
#' neighborhood?
#'
#' @return None
